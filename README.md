# Leveraging-Social-Determinants-of-Health-SDOH-Analytics-to-Address-Healthcare-Disparities
The purpose of this project is to design and implement an integrated system that centralizes SDOH data and automates workflows for real-time insights.
## 🔧 Tools used
- Microsoft Excel
- Power Query
- Power BI
- Power Automate
- Microsoft Powerpoint

## 👀 Project Overview
The project will focus on reducing data fragmentation, improving operational efficiency, and enabling proactive interventions. By connecting diverse datasets (clinical, socioeconomic, and geospatial) into a single platform, to streamline healthcare delivery and promote health equity across communities.

This initiative aims to:

Consolidate disparate clinical, demographic, and geospatial data into a single, unified system to ensure comprehensive insights into health disparities.

Implement automated workflows to streamline data processing and reduce the reliance on manual work, thus increasing efficiency and accuracy.

Create interactive dashboards to enable real-time monitoring of health disparities, facilitating quicker decision-making and interventions.

With real-time insights, empower healthcare providers and organizations to intervene early and address emerging health issues before they escalate.
